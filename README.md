# iReporter
Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables citizens to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that needs government intervention.
